## This is the unified term for Ex3.su
## We first construct the following loop
## h(h(X[0],h(X[1],X[0])),h(h(X[1],h(X[2],X[1])),L_0)) =?=  h(Y[0],h(Y[1],Y[0]))
## L <== h(h(X[2],h(X[3],X[2])),h(h(X[3],h(X[4],X[3])),L_2))
## Then we us it's unifier to construct the loop
## below. Interestingly there are no variables
## in the final loop after unification and the
## resulting term required 50 iterations to terminate.


h(h(R_0,h(W_1,R_0)),h(h(W_1,h(R_2,W_1)),L_0)) =?=  h(Y[0],h(Y[1],Y[0]))
L <== h(h(R_2,h(W_3,R_2)),h(h(W_3,h(R_4,W_3)),L_2))
R <== L_2
W <== h(W_3,h(R_4,W_3))
