## This is the unified loop term resulting from
## Ex2.su Notice that it is not linear or shallow
## and it does not contain any free variable classes
## Interestingly, unification problems of the form
## L_0 =?= f(L_0,L_0) seem to be unifiable in some
## cases even though there seems to be a cycle.

L_0 =?= f(Y_0,Y_0)
L <== f(f(X_0,X_0),L_1)
X <== L_2
Y <== L_1
